Subject: Appeal for Guideline 4.3(a) Rejection - Kazmer App (Submission ID: bc395d04-530a-4a4d-a731-55de31f686a0)

Dear Apple App Review Team,

I am writing to appeal the rejection of my application "Kazmer" (Version 1.0.0) under Guideline 4.3(a). I believe this rejection is a misunderstanding of my app's originality.

**App Originality:**

Kazmer is a 100% original Flutter application I developed for music festival enthusiasts. It combines festival discovery with AI-powered social interactions - this is completely original code, not a template or repackaged app.

**Unique Features:**

1. **Festival Discovery Engine**: Custom database with detailed 2025 music festival information including Coachella, Tomorrowland, and others with pricing, venues, and lineup data.

2. **AI Virtual Character System**: Original AI-generated characters with custom chat simulation and waterfall layout display algorithm.

3. **Original UI Design**: Custom theme system, unique tab bar implementation, and original visual effects.

**Technical Evidence:**

- Built entirely from scratch using Flutter with 15+ original Dart files
- Custom service architecture and data models
- No third-party templates used
- All assets are original or properly licensed

**No Previous Submissions:**

This is my first submission of this concept. I have never submitted similar apps under any other developer account or used any terminated accounts.

**Request for Reconsideration:**

I respectfully request the App Review Team reconsider this rejection. A review of the source code will demonstrate that Kazmer is an original application offering unique value to music festival enthusiasts.

I am happy to provide additional technical documentation or code samples to clarify the app's originality.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
